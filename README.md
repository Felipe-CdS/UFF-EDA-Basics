# **UFF-DSA-libbasic**
This repository contains all the basic algorithms and data structures presented in the 2022/1 DSA class. These are all sample libraries made by Professor Isabel Rosseti and can be used as a starting point for other projects.

# **Topics:**
1. Linked List;
2. Trees:
	- Binary Tree;
	- Binary Search Tree;
	- AVL Tree;
	- B Tree;
	- B+ Tree;
3. Graph;
4. Heap;
5. Hash Table;

# **To do:**
As this is a library made for classes, everything is made as simple as possible. Some parts must be modified to obtain a more generic and organized code. Here are some of my next steps to improve everything:

- [ ] A static library makefile rule to make things portable;
- [ ] Rewrite everything in english;
- [ ] Void pointer everywhere instead of int values;
- [ ] A readme file with a better explanationfor each struct;
